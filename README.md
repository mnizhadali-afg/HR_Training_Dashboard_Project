## Goal
Simulate improving and automating a hypothetical internal process (e.g., tracking training completion, feedback, or participant engagement) and visualize its performance. This project directly touches upon data integration, automation, visualization, and process thinking, with a strong link to your lecturing background.

## Scenario
Imagine a company has a global training department (like the one in the "Education Expert IT" role). They manually track course completion, participant feedback, and engagement across various platforms (some old, some new). Your task is to automate this, centralize the data, and provide insights.

## KPIs
1. **Course Completion Rate:** (Percentage of enrolled users who completed a course)
2. **Average Course Feedback Score**: (Overall satisfaction with courses)
3. **Active Participant Count:** (Number of unique users engaging with training each month/quarter)
4. **Training Hours Delivered:** (Total hours of training provided)
