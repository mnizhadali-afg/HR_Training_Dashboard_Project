## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Deployment Guide: A Dual-OS Journey

This project was developed by leveraging the strengths of both Linux for backend data processing and Windows for frontend visualization. Follow these phases carefully.

### **Phase 1: Setting up the Data Pipeline on Linux (Backend Processing)** üêß

_(Assumes you have Git, Docker Engine, and Python 3 installed on your Linux distribution.)_

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your Linux terminal and clone the project, then navigate into its directory:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/HR_Training_Dashboard_Project.git](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/HR_Training_Dashboard_Project.git)
    cd HR_Training_Dashboard_Project
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables (`.env` file):**
    Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the `HR_Training_Dashboard_Project/` directory. Fill it with your chosen database and pgAdmin credentials.

    ```env
    # .env file content
    POSTGRES_USER=your_postgres_user
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
    POSTGRES_DB=your_database_name_e.g._hr_training_db
    PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=your_pgadmin_email@example.com
    PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=your_pgadmin_password
    ```

3.  **Launch Database Services (Docker Compose):**
    Start your PostgreSQL database and pgAdmin containers in detached mode (`-d`):

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    Verify that both services are running and healthy:

    ```bash
    docker-compose ps
    ```

    _(Expected output: Both `db` and `pgadmin` services should show `Up (healthy)` under their status.)_

Absolutely ‚Äî here's a clean, **important section** you can include in your GitHub README under something like `üîå Connecting pgAdmin to PostgreSQL in Docker (Windows)`:

---

### üîå Connecting pgAdmin to PostgreSQL in Docker (Windows)

If you're using **Docker on Windows** and trying to connect **pgAdmin (in a container)** to your **PostgreSQL database (in another container)**, using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as the host **will not work**. That's because each container runs in its own network space.

#### ‚úÖ Use this instead:

```text
Host: host.docker.internal
Port: 5432
Username: <your POSTGRES_USER>      # e.g. mnizhadali
Password: <your POSTGRES_PASSWORD> # e.g. Simpl3P4ssword
Database: <your POSTGRES_DB>       # e.g. hr_training_db
```

`host.docker.internal` is a special DNS name that allows Docker containers to access the host machine, which is where PostgreSQL is actually exposed on port `5432`.

#### Example pgAdmin connection settings:

| Field             | Value                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Name              | `hr_training_db`       |
| Host name/address | `host.docker.internal` |
| Port              | `5432`                 |
| Username          | `mnizhadali`           |
| Password          | `Simpl3P4ssword`       |
| Maintenance DB    | `hr_training_db`       |

1.  **Prepare Python Environment & Run ETL:**
    Set up a Python virtual environment, install necessary libraries, and execute the ETL scripts:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install pandas sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary python-dotenv
    cd etl/
    python3 load_initial_data.py
    python3 transform_data.py
    cd .. # Navigate back to the project root
    ```

    _(This will load your raw CSVs and then transform them into the `fact_training_kpis` table in your PostgreSQL database.)_

2.  **Verify Data (Optional - via pgAdmin on Linux):**
    Open your web browser on Linux and go to `http://localhost:8080`. Log in with your pgAdmin credentials and connect to your PostgreSQL server (`db:5432`) to confirm the tables (especially `fact_training_kpis`) are populated.

3.  **Stop Docker Services on Linux:**
    Once ETL is complete on Linux, it's crucial to stop the containers before transitioning to Windows to avoid port conflicts and ensure data integrity.
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

### **Phase 2: Setting up the Dashboarding Environment on Windows (Frontend Visualization)** üñ•Ô∏è

_(Assumes you have Docker Desktop for Windows and Python 3 installed on your Windows OS, with Python added to PATH.)_

1.  **Transfer Project Files:**
    Copy the entire `HR_Training_Dashboard_Project/` folder from your Linux partition to a convenient location on your Windows drive (e.g., `C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\`).

2.  **Launch Docker Desktop for Windows:**
    Ensure Docker Desktop is running in your Windows system tray.

3.  **Restart Database Services on Windows:**
    Open a **new** Command Prompt (CMD) or PowerShell window, navigate to your copied project folder, and restart the Docker services:

    ```cmd
    cd C:\path\to\HR_Training_Dashboard_Project
    docker-compose up -d
    docker-compose ps
    ```

    _(Confirm `Up (healthy)` for both services.)_

4.  **Prepare Python Environment & Re-run ETL (for Windows Database Instance):**
    Although you ran ETL on Linux, it's crucial to re-run it now that a fresh PostgreSQL instance is running on Windows (unless you configured persistent volumes, which is not the default here).

    ```cmd
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install pandas sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary python-dotenv
    cd etl/
    python load_initial_data.py
    python transform_data.py
    cd ..
    ```

5.  **Verify Data (Recommended - via pgAdmin on Windows):**
    Open your web browser on Windows and go to `http://localhost:8080`. Log in and verify that your `fact_training_kpis` table contains the expected data.

6.  **Install Power BI Desktop:**
    Download and install Power BI Desktop from the official Microsoft website: [https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/).

7.  **Connect Power BI Desktop to PostgreSQL:**
    - Launch Power BI Desktop.
    - Click **"Get Data"** > **"PostgreSQL database"** > "Connect".
    - Enter Connection Details:
      - **Server:** `localhost`
      - **Port:** `5432`
      - **Database:** `your_database_name_e.g._hr_training_db` (from your `.env` file)
    - Click "OK".
    - In the next window, select **"Database"** on the left. Enter your `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`. Click "Connect".
    - In the "Navigator" window, expand your database and the `public` schema.
    - Select the **`fact_training_kpis`** table (and potentially other raw tables if you want them in Power BI for reference) and click **"Load"**.

### **Phase 3: Dashboard Design & Refinement in Power BI** üé®

1.  **KPI Calculation (DAX Measures):**
    You created several DAX measures for your KPIs:

    - `Total Completed Enrollments`
    - `Total Enrollments`
    - `Course Completion Rate` (formatted as Percentage)
    - `Average Feedback Score` (formatted as Decimal Number)
    - `Active Participant Count`
    - `Total Training Hours Delivered`

2.  **Dashboard Layout & Consolidation:**
    Organize your visuals across a maximum of 1-3 pages for optimal user experience and clarity.

    - **Page 1: "HR Training Overview"**
      - High-level KPI cards at the top.
      - Overall trends (e.g., Active Participants Over Time, Completion Rate Over Time) using line charts.
      - Primary breakdowns (e.g., Completion Rate by Course Category, Average Feedback by Course Category).
      - **Global Slicers:** `Department`, `Course Category`, `Enrollment Year` (or `enrollment_month_year`).
    - **Page 2 (Optional): "Detailed Course Performance"**
      - Focus on individual course names. Bar charts for `Average Feedback Score by Course Name`, `Completion Rate by Course Name`. Maybe a detailed table of course metrics.
    - **Page 3 (Optional): "Department & Participant Insights"**
      - Focus on departmental comparisons. Charts for `Active Participants by Department`, `Completion Rate by Department`, `Training Hours by Department`.

3.  **Refinement & Aesthetics:**
    - Apply a consistent Power BI theme (View tab > Themes).
    - Ensure clear titles for pages and individual visuals.
    - Use consistent font sizes, colors, and visual borders/shadows for a professional look.
    - Validate all interactions (slicers filtering all visuals correctly).
